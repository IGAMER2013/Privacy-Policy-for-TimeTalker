    <p>
        Last updated: 22/03/2023 This Privacy Policy describes how TimeTalker AI ("we," "us," or "our") collects, 
        uses, and discloses information from users of our mobile application (the "App"). 
        By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 
        Information Collection and Use TimeTalker AI uses third-party services, Google AdMob and OpenAI's GPT-3, 
        for advertising and artificial intelligence services, respectively. Google AdMob: We use Google AdMob to 
        display ads within our App. Google AdMob may collect information about you, such as your advertising identifier, 
        IP address, and device information, to serve personalized ads. You can learn more about how Google uses your information and 
        how to opt out of personalized ads by visiting Google's Privacy Policy at https://policies.google.com/privacy. OpenAI's GPT-3: 
        The App uses OpenAI's GPT-3 API to provide realistic conversations with historical characters. When you interact with the AI characters 
        in our App, the text you enter is sent to the GPT-3 API to generate responses. OpenAI may store and process this data 
        in accordance with their privacy policy, which can be found at https://platform.openai.com/docs/privacy-policy. 
        We do not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, email address, 
        or phone number, through the App. Changes to This Privacy Policy We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. 
        You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when 
        they are posted on this page. Contact Us If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us
